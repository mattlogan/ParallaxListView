### Get Started

Use a `ParallaxListView` where you'd normally use a `ListView`.

Call `setAdapter(ListAdapter adapter)` as you normally would.  Don't worry about the header.

Use the method `setHeaderDrawable(Drawable drawable)` to set a header image.

`ParallaxListView` also contains some styleable attributes, including "divider_color", "divider_height", "header_height", and "parallax_factor" -- see the sample app module for a demo.
